    <p>In reading , i discover love , good way to express myself much better in communication .. i love reading because it helps me to get away from reality:) ... I love to read because I can escape to another reality and imagine I am in the story. Because reading increases your vocabulary and your knowledge of how to correctly use new words, reading helps you clearly articulate what you want to say. The knowledge you gain from reading also gives you lots to talk about with others. I love talking to people - especially little kids - who read a lot
